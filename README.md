NAME
----

linecook - Linux system image builder

SYNOPSIS
--------

linecook setup - interactive setup

linecook help [`COMMAND`]- for specific command help

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Linecook builds system images utilizing overlayfs, squashfs, and linux containers via LXC. Currently, linecook only natively supports chef for provisioning, but using packer with a null resource, any of the mechanisms supported by packer are also supported by linecook.

Linecook is intended to serve 3 main purposes:

* Providing a simple, portable image building process that is useable both in baremetal and cloud deployments.
* Enabling a means of simple local image development with high production efficacy on Linux and OS X.
* Simplifying continuous integration and testing of linux systems.

USAGE
--------

```
linecook bake SPEC [-n --name `NAME`] [-s --snapshot]
  --name - The name
  --snapshot - Snapshot the resulting image for later use
  --encrypt - Encrypt the snapshot using the configured key. Implies snapshot.
  --upload - Upload the resulting image to the configured destination. Implies snapshot.
  --all - Snapshot, encrypt, and upload the resulting image.
  Build a linecook image defined by SPEC, with an optional name to help identify it. The default will be the SPEC name

linecook builder
  start - start a new builder
  stop - stop a running builder
  info - show the info about the builder
  ip - show the builder's ip

linecook config
  setup
  check - validate config
  show

linecook build
  list
  info NAME
  ip NAME
  stop NAME

linecook image
  list
  keygen - generate a new secret key for image encryption
  fetch
  find [`REGEX`] - list available remote images filtered by an optional regex

linecook ami [`image`] [-r --region `REGION1,REGION2`] [-x --xen-type `PV|HVM`] [-r --root-size GIGABYTES] - create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) from a snapshot.
```

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Describe config file here once it's been determined

PROVISIONERS
------------

Linecook includes an embedded chef-zero server, and uses the [chef-provisioner](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-provisioner) and [chefdepartie](https://rubygems.org/gems/chefdepartie) gems to have first-class support for local chef-zero builds.

However, if you're not using chef or don't want to use chef-zero, linecook can be used seamlessly with [packer](https://www.packer.io), and supports any of the Linux-based provisioners. This includes:

* Chef-solo
* Chef-client (with a real chef server)
* Ansible
* Puppet (masterless or server)
* Salt
* Plain old shell scripts

See the packer documentation for how to configure these provisioners.

To use a packerfile with linecook, just leave out the 'builder' section, or have the builder section be an empty array. You need only specify the 'provisioner' section, and other sections may cause errors. Linecook will automatically insert a null builder with the appropriate connection string for you.

Linecook with packer is a powerful combination, as it allows you to leverage packer's 'null builder' to take advantage of all of the provisioners packer already has really good support for. The result is an intermediate image format (squashfs) that can be easily applied to any target.

FILES
-----

*./linecook.yml*
  Local config file. Gets deep merged over the system config file. If not explicitly specified, found from current directory if exists.

*~/linecook/config.yml*
  The system wide configuration file, base or 'common' configuration. Other configurations get deep merged on top of this.

DEPENDENCIES
-----

Ruby 2.0 or greater, gem, and bundler.

Does not work and will never work on Windows.

### Linux

Only tested on Gentoo and Ubuntu

* lxc >= 1.0.7
* brutils
* dnsmasq
* iptables with masquerade support
* Linux 3.19 or greater with support for cgroups, and netfilter as described by lxc and iptables for NAT.


### OS X

* OS X 10.10 or later (Hypervisor.framework required for Xhyve)

QUIRKS
-----------

### Xhyve

+ Xhyve requires root privileges until https://github.com/mist64/xhyve/issues/60 is resolved. Linecook will setuid on the xhyve binary.

### Overlayfs

+ Overlayfs doesn't support unix domain sockets (yet), so anything using a unix domain socket outside of the /run tree should do manually symlink to /run.
+ Config file will allow you to explicitly mount tmpfs over things that don't do /run if you need to create unix domain sockets
